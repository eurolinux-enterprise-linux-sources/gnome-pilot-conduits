Why only new/changed records appear on the host?
------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, after initially syncing memo_file conduit you will only see
new/recently changed Memos on the local host, while everything is
still on the pilot. The problem is due to the fact that FastSync was
being performed instead of necessary initial SlowSync. To remedy the
problem force the SlowSync once. To do this simply change SyncPCid on
the PilotLink control panel (add 1 for example) After that the next
sync should be SlowSync and all your memos from pilot should be copied
to the host. You only need to do this once and all the following sync
_should_ correctly update any changes. In future we'll try to catch
this situation and force a SlowSync automatically.


How the conduit stores ids
--------------------------

In the main directory, a file called .categories of the format
	categorynumber;categoryname
is used to assign the category id to the records

In each category directory, theres a file called .ids, it contains
	id:secret:mtime;filename
used for matching a local file to a pilot record (the id),
and to  figure out when local record was updated.

mtime is actually the same for everything and is basically the last sync time,
but this was easier. Perhaps it should be global.

How to manipulate files locally
-------------------------------

You should not do the following :
	- rename categories, the conduit won't be able to assign a category to	
 	the record, and the record will end in Unfiled. 
	- rename files, since the .ids containing the RecordId won't be in sync
	- move files, again, the .ids file will be out of sync

You can do:
	- delete a file, the file will be deleted on the pilot
        - add a file to a category, if the filename can't be found in the .ids file,
	the record is marked as new.
	- edit a file, don't worry about the title of the memo (the first line of the
	file), it will be correct on the pilot, and after sync, the file will have
	the new name, just don't rename it.


How to remedy the things that can't be done locally?
----------------------------------------------------

Well, you can either rewrite the conduit, I had thought about writing the id and
secret attribute in the filename, but that would yield files like
	"Memos/Unfiles/34254543.1.Story about a conduit"
yech.

Or you could write a tool to do it, maybe a vfs for mc ?
